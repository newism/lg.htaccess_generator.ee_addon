* <code>{ee:template_groups}</code> is replaced with a pipe delimited list of this sites template groups with a pipe "|" appended.
* <code>{ee:pages}</code> is replaced with a pipe delimited list of this sites page urls with a pipe "|" appended.
* <code>{ee:404}</code> is replaced with the sites 404 path ie: site/404.
