Technical requirements include:

* PHP5
* A modern browser: [Firefox][firefox], [Safari][safari], [Google Chrome][chrome] or IE8+

Other requirements:

### Configuration

LG .htaccess Generator has the following extension settings which need to be entered separately for each Multi-Site Manager site.

Note: All configuration options are site specific. When a new site is created be sure to save the extension settings for the new site to avoid errors.

#### Enable extension

##### Enable LG .htaccess Generator for this site?

Enabling LG .htaccess Generator will copy the .htaccess template into the .htaccess file whenever a template is saved via the CP or a new page is created using the Pages module.

#### .htaccess configuration

LG .htaccess Generator requires that an existing .htaccess file exists and is writable. Non LG .htacess rules these will not be modified by this extension.

##### .htaccess server path

    /Users/admin/Sites/Internal/local.expressionengine/www/

The path where your `.htaccess` file is located. Must be writable by the server.

##### .htaccess template

    # secure .htaccess file
    <Files .htaccess>
    order allow,deny
    deny from all
    </Files>
    
    # EE 404 page for missing pages
    ErrorDocument 404 /index.php?/{ee:404}
    
    # Simple 404 for missing files
    <FilesMatch "(\.jpe?g|gif|png|bmp|css|js|flv)$">
    ErrorDocument 404 "File Not Found"
    </FilesMatch>
    
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    
    # remove the www
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.$) [NC]
    RewriteRule ^ http://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
    
    # Add a trailing slash to paths without an extension
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5}|/)$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1/ [L,R=301]
    
    # Remove index.php
    # Uses the "include method"
    # http://expressionengine.com/wiki/Remove_index.php_From_URLs/#Include_List_Method
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !^(ACT=.*)$ [NC] # EE Actions
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5})$ # files
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/({ee:template_groups}{ee:pages}members|P[0-9]{2,8}) [NC]
    RewriteRule (.*) /index.php?$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [L]

The tgas below will be replaced with their associated values in the .htaccess template:

* `{ee:template_groups}` will be replaced with a pipe delimited list of this sites template groups
* `{ee:pages}` will be replaced with a pipe delimited list of this sites page urls
* `{ee:404}` will be replaced with the sites 404 path ie: site/404

Read more about the "include method" of removing your sites index.php on the [ExpressionEngine Wiki][ee_include_method].

If you are using the Pages or Structure module make sure you add: `{ee:pages}` into the include string after `{ee:template_groups}`. If you are not using the Pages or Structure module remove this tag.
